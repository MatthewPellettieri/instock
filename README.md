Hello! This project was created to simulate a real database holding various information about products in warehouses in various locations. The application consists of a user-friendly front-end interface with a database setup in MySQL and an API that handles the logic using Knex.js to communicate with the DB. 

## Features
- Ability to check stock of items across various warehouses
- Ability to Add, Delete, or Edit warehouse items by communicating with the API
- Ability to monitor quantity of items in warehouse and display accurate readings of item count and automatically update when an item is out of stock
